# React Native Learning Exercises

- The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for me to undertake small exercises as part of my React Native learning journey.

## What is React Native?

- React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It was developed by Facebook and is now used by many companies to build high-quality, cross-platform apps. React Native allows developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase, which can save a lot of time and effort.

## Why Small Exercises?

- I've found that one of the best ways to learn a new technology is by doing small, focused exercises. These exercises allow me to practice specific skills and concepts without getting overwhelmed by a large project. By breaking down my learning into smaller chunks, I can make progress more quickly and build confidence as I go.

## Installation
```
npx create-expo-app
```

Or with router:
```
npx create-expo-app@latest --example with-router ./
```
Then go to Power Shell terminal and:
```

Then scan the barcode.
