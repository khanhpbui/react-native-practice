# React Native Learning Exercises

- This repository contains a collection of small exercises that I used as part of my journey to learn React Native. I've created this repository to keep track of my progress.

## What is React Native?

- React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It was developed by Facebook and is now used by many companies to build high-quality, cross-platform apps. React Native allows developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase, which can save a lot of time and effort.

## Why Small Exercises?

- I've found that one of the best ways to learn a new technology is by doing small, focused exercises. These exercises allow me to practice specific skills and concepts without getting overwhelmed by a large project. By breaking down my learning into smaller chunks, I can make progress more quickly and build confidence as I go.
